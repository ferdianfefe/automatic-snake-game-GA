# Hybrid Genetic Algorithm for Automatic Snake Game

Automatic snake game using hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) to find the best snake game strategy. The HGA is a combination of genetic algorithm (GA) and neural network (NN). The GA is used to find the best snake game strategy and the NN is to generate the brain for each snake individual.

# How to run

1. Install necessary libraries (numpy, tkinter)
2. Run `python main.py`
3. Observes the result
4. Enjoy
